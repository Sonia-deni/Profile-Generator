  ## Description
  This project takes a user input from the command line and saves details of each member of a team until the user input is completed. Multiple classes, inheritance and prototypes are used to define and create employee objects, and Jest is used for testing. When details of all team members are entered, this is then rendered and saved to a HTML file.
